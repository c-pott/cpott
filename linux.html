            <h1>why use a tiling window manager?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                <h2><li><b>keeping it minimal</b></li></h2><br>

                Almost every approach I take with technology is geared towards being productive by minimalizing distraction and maximizing the systems features. My iPhone has zero apps on the homescreen, only a single widget that contains shortcuts to necessary applications such as messages, phone, email, etc. Taking all of the unnecessary bloat off my homescreen not only saves on storage space, but it also diverts my attention away from time-wasting applications. When I discovered what a tiling window manager was, this minimal philosophy was one that was now possible to implement on my personal computer.<br> <br>
                
                <h2><li><b>use cases</b></li></h2><br>

                The Graphical User Interface is one of, if not the greatest implementation to daily computer usage. The ease of use allows anyone to point and click, change their system for personal best use cases. When Steve Jobs essentially stole the idea for the GUI from Xerox (great story btw), he knew that it was the key to bridging the gap between a computer hobbyist and the average joe, and it would be the driving force as to why normal people would buy the product for decades. <i>Simplicity.</i> However, for those possibly seeking a much faster way to dive right into their own workflow when sitting down at their desktop, a tiling window manager is a very preferable choice. Instead of programs opening in free floating windows where you have to click & drag, maximize or minimize, each window will essentially flex to one another inside of one workspace.
                
                Within an arch based linux distrubtion, users are able to use either a floating window management system, or a tiling window managment system. The main user base of arch distros with a tiling window manager are programmers and software devs alike. This is mainly due to how quickly it allows them to get directly into their workflow without ever touching the mouse. The CLI of arch distros is the literal backbone of how the user will guide through their system. In a tiling window manager, devs can open their CLI with one single keyboard bind. No clicking the search bar, and then typing command prompt or cmd, and then clicking the emulator. You are always multiple steps ahead of someone using a floating window system, even Gnome users. Faster and optimized workflow = better productivity at a greater rate.<br><br>
                
                <h2><li><b>window systems and their window managers</b></li></h2><br>
                The X window system has been very popular for decades among linux users, notable tiling WMs within X include i3, dwm, awesome, and bspwm (which I used on my thinkpad). But for those who have actually have a personality and feel for aesthetics, Hyprland is the number one choice. If you browse through r/unixporn for just a few minutes, I would bet my life savings (not a lot, but it's honest) that 90% of the posts you see are Hyprland. Hyprland is a WM within the Wayland window system, and today it is used by those looking to optimize their workflow and easily customize their workspace to their full imaginative capacity, otherwise known as "ricing". When I finally took the leap from bspwm into hyprland, I was instantly convinced that I made the right choice. What took me <u>days</u> to configure in bspwm, only took about a half a day in hyprland. To be fair, if I "read the f'ing manual" like all of the arch users with MASSIVE god complexes had suggested in the forums, I could have figured it out a lot sooner, but I'm a noob arch user, and that's a rant for another time.<br><br>

                <h3><li><b>footnotes // video</b></li></h3>

                Below you can see me demonstrate my hyprland config and do my best to explain how the environment works while simultaneously trying to convince you that it <i>is</i> better than a floating window system in terms of speed and user customization. Just trust me, it is. All-in-all my personal objectives with using a tiling window manager on linux is to better understand the file system from the ground up, and to optimize workflow for more productivity. The end goal of course, is <i>achieving a minimal design while increasing productivity</i><br><br>
                
                My dot files are not publicly on github, once I do upload them I will come back to this blog and update accordingly. If you actually took the time to read this blog, thank you.
