            <h1> Why Linux?</h1>
        <div class='center'>
            <p>
                Linux is an open source operating system developed by Linus Torvalds as a “small project”. Winodws dominates the 
                worldwide market share of operating systems, but not many people know that even Microsoft uses Linux in their cloud platforms to handle their 
                massive workloads from users. Why do they do this? The answer is quite simple. More support and flexibility. Linux achieves these two 
                attributes by being an open source platform, with millions of developers. When a user reaches out for help online with a Linux bug, they’re 
                inadvertently contributing to the development and improvement of Linux. It’s used in a personal computing space and work computing spaces for 
                good reason, but how does it do both of these, and fit every other use case for users?

                There are an insane amount of distributions (distros) that Linux 
                is available in. All of them are designed and supported with the 
                user and their use case in mind. Some of the more popular ones 
                (and derivatives) are Red Hat with Fedora & CentOS, Ubuntu & Ubuntu
                 Server, Debian with Linux Mint & Kali Linux, and Arch with 
                 anjaro and NixOS. These are all very well known in the Linux 
                 community, and I am not listing roughly 95% of all other linux 
                 distributions. Click<a href="(https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=family-tree)"> here</a> for a full distro 
                 family tree if you’re interested. So with all of this in mind – there is 
                 certainly a Linux distro for everyone. Determining which one is the hardest 
                 part. Want to transition smoothly from Windows? Use Mint or Ubuntu. Want a 
                 system that is easily redistrubitable? Use NixOS. Need to maintain server side 
                 operations? Use Debian. Want a system with no bloat out of the box? Use an Arch 
                 based distro.
