                Almost every approach I take with technology is geared towards being productive by minimalizing distraction and maximizing the systems features. My iPhone has zero apps on the homescreen, only a single widget that contains shortcuts to necessary applications such as messages, phone, email, etc. Taking all of the unnecessary bloat off my homescreen not only saves on storage space, but it also diverts my attention away from time-wasting applications.<br> <br>
