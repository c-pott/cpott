            <h1>Why Linux?</h1>
        <div class='center'>
            <p>
                Linux is an open source operating system developed by Linus Torvalds as a “small project”. Winodws dominates the 
                worldwide market share of operating systems, but not many people know that even Microsoft uses Linux in their cloud platforms to handle their 
                massive workloads from users. Why do they do this? The answer is quite simple. More support and flexibility. Linux achieves these two 
                attributes by being an open source platform, with millions of developers. When a user reaches out for help online with a Linux bug, they’re 
                inadvertently contributing to the development and improvement of Linux. It’s used in a personal computing space and work computing spaces for 
                good reason, but how does it do both of these, and fit every other use case for users?

        <h1>Flavors of Linux</h1>
        <div class='center'>
            <p>
                There are an insane amount of distributions (distros) that Linux 
                is available in. All of them are designed and supported with the 
                user and their use case in mind. Some of the more popular ones 
                (and derivatives) are Red Hat with Fedora & CentOS, Ubuntu & Ubuntu
                 Server, Debian with Linux Mint & Kali Linux, and Arch with 
                 anjaro and NixOS. These are all very well known in the Linux 
                 community, and I am not listing roughly 95% of all other linux 
                 distributions. Click <a href="https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=family-tree">here</a> for a full distro 
                 family tree if you’re interested. So with all of this in mind – there is 
                 certainly a Linux distro for everyone. Determining which one is the hardest 
                 part. Want to transition smoothly from Windows? Use Mint or Ubuntu. Want a 
                 system that is easily redistrubitable? Use NixOS. Need to maintain server side 
                 operations? Use Debian. Want a system with no bloat out of the box? Use an Arch 
                 based distro.

        <h1>Why I choose Linux</h1>
        <div class='center'>
            <p>
                The last sentence of the previous section. No bloat. As someone 
                who has spent the majority of my life using Windows systems I am 
                saddened to see the amount of bloatware and feature heavy slop that
                 Microsoft has pushed onto their paying customers. I could care 
                 less about having a news widget on my desktop or an AI assistant 
                 in my taskbar. The amount of garbage that comes with a vanilla 
                 Windows system is also extremely resource consuming. There is 
                 zero reason why a fresh install of Windows with no third party 
                 applications installed should take upwards of 40% of my computers 
                 memory at idle. Another major reason is the customization that is 
                 available with Linux. You can make your operating system, yours. 
                 If I want a wallpaper switcher that cycles through 150 images I 
                 have saved with the click of two buttons, I can do that on Linux. 
                 If I want to customize my taskbar with various theming based on 
                 these images, I can also do that. You can essentially build Linux 
                 from the ground up as much as you want based on the distribution 
                 that you chose. And the best part, it’s all free and open-sourced 
                 software. Sure a lot of Windows applications do not have direct 
                 Linux support (Office apps, Photoshop, Spotify, etc.) But there 
                 are alternatives and workarounds for all of these thanks to the 
                 OS being open-source. I personally wanted a system that aligned 
                 with all of these reasons that was also minimal to keep me from 
                 distraction, therefore I landed on an Arch based system.

        <h1>I use Arch, btw</h1>
        <div class='center'>
            <p>
                Arch Linux was created in 2002 and has followed a rolling release 
                update model ever since. What is a rolling release? Almost every 
                single day there are new updates being made to Arch in small 
                increments at time. Instead of complete system overhauls and 
                redesigns Arch updates bit by bit very frequently. This is great 
                from a software perspective because this means there is constant 
                support for the system and fixes are addressed very quickly. Arch 
                is known as the most minimal and least invasive Linux distro 
                around. It’s not recommended for beginner users looking to 
                transition smoothly from Windows into Linux because of the manual 
                intervention that is needed for installation and system 
                maintanence, however if you’re someone who wants complete 
                customization and control over how your system functions – then 
                Arch is the way to go. As I mentioned before, I want a minimal 
                system that will keep distractions away from me at all cost. The 
                UI for iPhones is designed to keep your attention on the screen 
                for as long as possible, doom scrolling app to app to keep you 
                engaged for as long as possible. My iPhone is also designed 
                minimally to limit distraction. I want my computer to be the same 
                way. Computers are literally a cheat code in terms of knowledge 
                and power that they supply to the human brain. No other time in 
                history has information been so easily available to us with a few 
                clicks and key presses. My own self interests include learning as 
                much as possible before I exit this world (hopefully later than 
                sooner). I want to read as much as I can, watch as many movies as I 
                can, research as many topics as I can. I have a few applications on 
                my home computer such as Obsidian that allow for this, but the 
                overall platform needs to fit this requirement also to be a complete 
                and well rounded system for self productivity. 
                
                <br><br>
                TLDR: Arch aligns with my philosophy on life and it’s awesome.

        <h1>What is a tiling window manager? What’s Hyprland?</h1>
        <div class='center'>
            <p>
                Tiling window managers. They’re not very well known to the average 
                computer user. Many of us understand that computers can be 
                interacted with mainly by using the mouse to point and click, 
                drag and drop, etc. If you’re like me, you like to have multiple 
                tabs and windows open at one time on one monitor. Typically the 
                side by side view of windows is my go to for work and productivity.
                If this is also your preferred window layout, you understand that 
                it can sometimes be annoying to organize them with the overlap, 
                sizing, and selection by having to click the window you want to 
                work within. A tiling window manager automates every bit of this 
                for you. The best part? No mouse is even needed. All of the 
                switiching and sizing can be done with keybinds you set within 
                your systems config files. There are a few tiling window managers 
                that are used by Linux users such as the old i3, the not as old 
                bspwm (I used to use this), and the new kid on the block; 
                Hyprland. Hyprland is built using the newer display server 
                protocol Wayland. The older but still reliable option is Xorg, 
                which is largely used in normal DEs (Desktop Environments) such 
                as KDE Plasma. Arch allows you to use both of these and choose 
                which display server you want to use at start up, but I mainly 
                use Wayland with Hyprland so that’s what we’ll focus on for now. 
                Hyprland is a dynamic tiling window manager for Linux that is 
                absolutely gorgeous. The configuration uses a .config file format
                that is stupidly easy to follow and customize. The integration 
                of other modules that don’t come stock with Hyprland are 
                typically composed of .config files, JSON, some CSS for colors, 
                and shell scripting to have them all interact smoothly with one 
                another. If you watch the demonstration below, the taskbar is a 
                great example of all of this. The bar itself is created using a 
                JSON file, declaring the various modules (L to R: Workspaces, 
                Now Playing, Current Window, VPN, Internet, Volume, Time). A CSS 
                file is used to declare all of the colors for the background of 
                the bar and text color. Some scripting is needed to pull in the 
                info for certain modules such as the Now Playing and VPN ones. 
                Using scripting you can display the current song/video that’s 
                playing and the current VPN location. Finally, the bar is set to
                execute at startup within the main Hyprland .config file. 
                Simple enough, right? I’m barely scratching the surface in terms
                of the customization that Hyprland allows for. To see a 
                sickening amount of aesthetically pleasing Hyprland 
                configurations, check out r/unixporn. Many of the posts will 
                have a linked github page with the users dot files, showing 
                how they created their setup and even allowing you to take 
                pieces of their build to use in your own configuration.

        <div class='center'>
            <p>
                I love my computer. I feel more productive than ever with this 
                operating system and I feel free knowing that I can fix it to my 
                liking however and whenever I want. With that being said, it is a 
                very sharp double edged sword. Any change or new update could 
                brick your system and require you to deep dive in reddit and arch 
                forums for hours in an attempt to find out why your NVIDIA drivers 
                will no longer update. But at the end of the day you will be far 
                more in tune and familiar with your system than any windows 
                plebeian could ever dream of.
