            <h1>The Linux Tiling WM</h1>
            <hr>

                Almost every approach I take with technology is geared towards being productive by minimalizing distraction and maximizing the systems features. My iPhone has zero apps on the homescreen, only a single widget that contains shortcuts to necessary applications such as messages, phone, email, etc. Taking all of the unnecessary bloat off my homescreen not only saves on storage space, but it also diverts my attention away from time-wasting applications.<br> <br>
                
                The Graphical User Interface is one of, if not the greatest implementation to daily computer usage. The ease of use allows anyone to point and click, change their system for personal best use cases. For those possibly seeking a much faster way to dive right into their own workflow when sitting down at their desktop, a tiling window manager is a very preferable choice. Instead of programs opening in free floating windows where you have to click & drag, maximize or minimize, each window will essentially flex to one another inside of one workspace.
                
                Within an arch based linux distrubtion, users are able to use either a floating window management system, or a tiling window managment system. The main target market for arch distros are programmers and software devs alike. This is mainly due to how quickly it allows them to get directly into their workflow without ever having to touch the mouse after booting their computer on. The CLI of arch distros is the literal backbone of how the user will guide through their system. In a tiling window manager, devs can open their CLI with one single keyboard bind. No clicking the search bar, typing command prompt or cmd, and then clicking the emulator. You are always multiple steps ahead of someone using a floating window system. Faster and optimized workflow = better productivity at a greater rate. The X window system has been very popular for decades now among linux users, notable tiling WM include i3, dwm, awesome, and bspwm. But for those who actually value having a aesthetically pleasing desktop, Wayland is the number one choice. If you browse through r/unixporn for just a few minutes, I would bet my life savings (not a lot, but it's honest) that 90% of the posts you see are either Wayland or Hyprland. Hyprland is a WM within Wayland, and today it is used by those looking to optimize their workflow and easily customize their workspace to their own imaginative capacity. When I finally took the leap from bspwm into hyprland, I was convinced that I made the right choice. What took me <u>days</u> to configure in bspwm, only took about a half a day in hyprland. Which, if I "read the f'ing manual" like all of the arch users with MASSIVE god complexes had suggested in the forums, I could have figured it out a lot sooner, but that's a rant for another time.<br><br>

                Below you can see me demonstrate my hyprland config and do my best to explain how the environment works while simultaneously trying to convince you that it <i>is</i> better than your floating window system. Just trust me, it is. My dot files are not publicly on github, once I do upload them I will come back to this blog and update accordingly. If you actually took the time to read this blog, thank you.
