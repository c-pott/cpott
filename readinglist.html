                    <p>
                        It took me 22 years to realize that written literature is one of the most important creations in human history. The ability to read and tap into the 
                        mind of an author from centuries ago, where the writings have been passed down, translated, or reinterpreted over generations, is made possible by two 
                        sets of people: the author and the reader. Not everyone is a gifted writer—I, myself, struggle with putting my thoughts onto paper or even explaining 
                        them aloud for others to understand. However, I firmly believe that everyone has the capacity for deep thought when reading books. While attention spans 
                        may vary, even a short period of focus can lead to something meaningful being retained when reading.
                        <br><br>
                        I never read much until about three years ago, when I realized that our lives only grant us so many experiences, each teaching us a limited number of 
                        lessons. In my lifetime, I’ll never know firsthand what it’s like to live in a dystopian world where books are outlawed, be a wizard at Hogwarts, or 
                        experience life as a philosopher with a unique outlook on life and death. However, through writing and reading, we can glimpse these different realities, 
                        taking lessons from them and applying them to our own lives where they fit. This is why reading is important—it allows us to explore entirely different 
                        lives from our own. In a world where we are more isolated from one another than ever before, I believe this is crucial for developing open-mindedness 
                        and intellectual growth.
                        <br><br>
                        Below is a list of books I plan to read at my own pace. Some are by authors whose work I'm familiar with, while others are recommendations I found 
                        online that seemed interesting. My goal is to learn as much as possible. This includes exploring a wide range of political, philosophical, and 
                        imaginative writings before I pass away. I don’t want to find myself on my deathbed wishing I had read more on stoicism. To understand the ideologies 
                        that humans have created and documented, it’s essential to read the literature behind each one—even the ones I may disagree with. Having an open-minded 
                        approach to these opposing viewpoints is the only true way to comprehend why humans thought the way they did, how they thought, and when they thought 
                        certain things throughout history.
                        <br><br>
                        Knowledge is power, and books are the epitome of knowledge.
